                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDuring the summer of 2020, I chose to sharpen my programming skills, and take the dive into front end development.&nbsp At this time, I, 
                    along-side many other prominent learners, seized the opportunity to take part in the Hack Your Own Summmer Internship program.</br><br>
                    
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe HYO program consisted of a 4 part itinerary covering all aspects of basic front end devlopment.&nbsp It drew from other large programs such as the Odin Project, and
                    freeCodeCamp, molding all available resources into one plan more comprehensive than the parts.&nbsp As we learners worked through each week's material, we had constant
                    access to a number of experienced mentors to bounce ideas off of, and better cement ideas for routine projects we were working on.</br><br>
  
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom this experience, I got my first look as to what it would be like to work as part of a team in a development environment.&nbsp 
                    The need for communication and punctuality were made apparent as part of this.&nbsp I also learned the importance of networking, and keeping in touch with those that may help propel your future success.&nbsp 
                    To this end, I created a linkedin profile and have still been able to follow the progress of the many bright individuals I worked with.</br><br> 
                    
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn hard skills, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, the concept of programming stacks, and a little JavaScript.
