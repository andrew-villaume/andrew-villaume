            <h2 class="textHeader">Love for Technology:</h2>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom the very first time I was able to get my hands on a computer, I fell in love.&nbsp 
                The concept of the internet invigorated me, and having the power of the world's communal knowlege at my 
                  fingertips felt just as alien as it was incredible.&nbsp   
                  Ironically, however, it was not until I took my first programming course that I seriously considered 
                  focusing my degree in the world which I loved.&nbsp Since having found a passion in this, and programming, I have become 
                invested in the fields of machine learning and data analysis.&nbsp I hold question for how these fields can be weighed in others,
                such as machine learning in medicine, and data analytics in history and biology.&nbsp In this way, I am still uncertain as to how my love for technology 
                can be applied towards potential career paths - and it is a question I leave open as I start taking my first steps in fleshing a career.  </p>

            <h2 class="textHeader">Programming and Critical Thinking:</h2>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne thing I love about programming is its tendency to draw on one's critical thinking.&nbsp Solution's to any one problem are rarely ever perfectly linear, and 
            contentions as to what would work best in any situation draws from many lines of thinking and from many individuals background knowledge.&nbsp It is in these scenarios that my love 
            for programming is most apparent.&nbsp In time's past, it is also where I have been most clearly able to demonstrate my skills in critical thinking.

            <h2 class="textHeader">E-Sports:</h2>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRegarding my personal interests, video games have long been a passion of mine, and are a large part of who I am and what drives me.&nbsp Reaching Global Elite in Counterstrike, for example, 
                is an accomplishment I still use to target myself relative in other fields.&nbsp It is because in Counterstrike and other games, I am deeply invested in playing at a high level.&nbsp In college, I pursued this further by playing a couple titles in the Collegiate Star League.&nbsp
                  From these experiences, and having played 
            on teams before this, I have also learned the many intricate parts of what drives a team, and what methods of communication breed success.&nbsp It is my hope that I can 
            bring this knowledge towards a team, and apply it in a professional setting.            </p>

            <h2 class="textHeader">Business Ventures:</h2>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspApart from video games, I also enjoy pursuing different business ventures.&nbsp A project which took most of my attention
                a couple years ago was that of "SleepHaven", an online retail front I started for a variety of sleeping aids.&nbsp In High School, I also competed at a state level 
                doing business role-plays under the umbrella of a program called DECA.&nbsp With this experience comes question for myself as to whether 
                I would want to be in a leading or otherwise a mangement position.&nbsp Should it ever be something to consider, I have taken a number of entreprenurial courses in school, filling some of the business understanding
                that these roles would require.

            <h2 class="textHeader">Adversity:</h2>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo know me, you must also know that I am no stranger to adversity.&nbsp 
                From debilitating migraines to psychotic breaks, I have been woefully tested during my time as a college student.&nbsp 
                    However, having come out the tail end of these, I feel as empowered as I ever have.&nbsp Simply, as the old adage goes, 
                    "Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger", and I feel as hardened to adversity as I am sure of my ability to persevere
                    through whatever challenges that may come my way.
